Glaucoma Detection with CNN and Flask

This repository implements a Glaucoma Detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) integrated with Flask. The CNN is trained to classify retinal images as either glaucoma or non-glaucoma. The Flask web application facilitates user-friendly image uploads for real-time predictions.

Features:


CNN Model: Trained for accurate glaucoma detection on diverse retinal image datasets.
Flask Web App: Easily upload images, receive instant predictions.
HTML & CSS: Intuitive and visually appealing frontend.
Project Structure:
models/: Trained CNN model in .h5 format.
app/: Flask application files.
static/: CSS and static assets.
templates/: HTML templates.
app.py: Main Flask application script.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for model training and analysis.
requirements.txt: Dependencies.
